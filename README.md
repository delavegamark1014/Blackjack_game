# Blackjack Game
Welcome to my blackjack game project! This project is an interactive and engaging web-based game that allows users to play the classic casino game of blackjack online.

## Technologies Used
This project was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The front-end was designed with a modern and user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS, while the game logic was implemented using JavaScript.

## Features
* A realistic and immersive user interface that mimics the look and feel of a real casino blackjack table


* Interactive gameplay that allows users to hit, stand, or double down based on their current hand


* Advanced game logic that incorporates standard blackjack rules, such as dealer hitting on soft 17 and paying 3:2 for a natural blackjack


* Customizable betting options that allow users to choose their initial bet size and adjust their bet throughout the game


* An intuitive and easy-to-use interface that makes playing blackjack online simple and fun

## Getting Started
To get started with the Blackjack game, simply download or clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine. Open the index.html file in your web browser to launch the game.

### Gameplay
The objective of the game is to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value, without going over 21. The game begins with the player placing a bet using the chips provided.

Once the player has placed their bet, they can click the 'Deal' button to begin the game. The player and dealer will both receive two cards, with one of the dealer's cards facing down.

The player can then choose to 'Hit' or 'Stand'. If the player chooses to 'Hit', they will receive another card. If the player's hand value goes over 21, they 'Bust' and lose the game. If the player chooses to 'Stand', their turn ends, and the dealer will reveal their facedown card.

The dealer must continue to draw cards until their hand value is 17 or higher. If the dealer's hand value goes over 21, the player wins. If the dealer's hand value is closer to 21 than the player's hand value, the dealer wins. If the player's hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value, the player wins.
